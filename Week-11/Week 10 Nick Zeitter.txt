Doing style tiles for me comes across almost as a waste of time because in my head it doesn’t really click of how the website is going to look or feel vs the full comp version. I could get by with just a style tile but I think only that is a waste. I probably spent 20 minutes on each style tile and then 20 minutes on the front page full design. I just think with how my brain works the style tiles alone is a poor way to go and the full mockup is much better.
